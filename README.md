This repository is divided into 2 datasets, namely JSC1 and JSC2. Each dataset consists of 3 training data and testing data which are used for vehicle classification, head detection, and helmetless head detection.
1. The first training data (JSC1_Data_Training1 and JSC2_Data_Training1) are used for the training process of vehicle classification.
2. The second training data (JSC1_Data_Training2 and JSC2_Data_Training2) are used for the training process of head detection.
3. The third training data (JSC1_Data_Training3 and JSC2_Data_Training3) are used for the training process of head detection without wearing a helmet.
4. Testing data (JSC1_Data_Testing and JSC2_Data_Testing) consisting of motorcycle and non-motorcycle images are used for vehicle classification testing. While the image of a motorcycle is used for testing head detection and helmetless head detection.
